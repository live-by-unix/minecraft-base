VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS IS ONLY FOR MINECRAFT JAVA. Version 1.21.11. You can upgrade and downgrade at your own risk, however this may result in corruption and even crashing of the game. 

To play, follow these steps.

1. Download the map
  
2. Put the map in your saves folder 

   * Windows: %appdata%\.minecraft\saves\
   * macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/saves/
   * Linux: ~/.minecraft/saves/

3. Load up Minecraft Java
4. Enjoy!

# Common Error
1. Not taking out the map out of the folder. Because of how GitHub packages code when you get the folder (unzipped) you should see what is inside.
You should see one sub-folder PUT THAT IN YOUR SAVES.
